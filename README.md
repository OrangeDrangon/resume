# Resume
This a basic start to a portfolio/resume site. It is nothing fancy and still needs a lot of polish.

## Details
It is developed using sapper which is SSR svelte. It is a new technology that I am having fun playing with.
The bundle size is small and it loads fast. This is probably an abuse of JS when this could be a static webpage
but I am learning.


## Running it Locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies
3. `yarn dev` / `yarn build && yarn start` Depending on whether or not you want a development build.
